For this exercise, the bonus exercises are mixed in with the other questions but you are welcome to skip them if you do not want go for the bonus part of the exercise.\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Filtering data\n\nFind all states that belong to the West region, have an area below 250,000 km2 and in 2015 a population greater than 5,000,000 residents (**Hint:** you may need to use the function `units::set_units()` or `as.numeric()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |>\n  filter(\n    as.numeric(AREA) < 250000,\n    total_pop_15 > 5000000\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nFind all states that belong to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km2 or a total population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |>\n  filter(\n    REGION == \"South\" |\n      as.numeric(AREA) > 150000 |\n      total_pop_15 > 7000000\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Joining and summarizing data\n\nWhat was the total population in 2015 in the `us_states` dataset?

How many of these high points does the Canterbury region contain?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncanterbury <- nz |>\n  filter(Name == \"Canterbury\")\n\ncanterbury_height <- nz_height |>\n  slice_max(order_by = elevation, n = 100) |>\n  st_filter(canterbury)\n\nnrow(canterbury_height)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Bonus:** plot the result using the `ggplot2::geom_sf()` function to show all of New Zealand, `canterbury` region highlighted in yellow, high points in Canterbury represented by red crosses (**Hint:** try using `shape = 7`) and high points in other parts of New Zealand represented by blue circles.\n\nSee the help page `?ggplot2::shape` and run the examples to see an illustration of different `shape` values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nz) +\n  geom_sf(data = canterbury, fill = \"yellow\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_filter(nz_height, canterbury), shape = 7, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_filter(nz_height, canterbury, .predicate = st_disjoint), shape = 1, color = \"blue\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhich region has the second highest number of `nz_height` points, and how many does it have?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnz_height |>\n  st_intersection(nz) |>\n  st_drop_geometry() |>\n  count(Name) |>\n  slice_max(n = 2, order_by = n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nGeneralizing the question to all regions: how many of New Zealand's 16 regions contain points which belong to the top 100 highest points in the country? Which regions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnz_height |>\n  slice_max(n = 100, order_by = elevation) |>\n  st_intersection(nz) |>\n  st_drop_geometry() |>\n  count(Name)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Bonus:** create a table listing these regions in order of the number of points and their name.

Which state has the longest border and which has the shortest? **Hint:** The `st_length` function computes the length of a `LINESTRING` or `MULTILINESTRING` geometry.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states_borders <- us_states |>\n  st_cast(\n    to = \"MULTILINESTRING\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    border_length = st_length(geometry)\n  ) |>\n  st_drop_geometry()\n\n\nslice_max(us_states_borders, order_by = border_length, n = 1)\n\nslice_min(us_states_borders, order_by = border_length, n = 1)\n```\n:::\n",
