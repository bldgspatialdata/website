These exercises build on our last exercise using `{dplyr}` and include some of the same skills including:\n\n-   Filtering rows or observations\n-   Grouping and summarizing data by variable\n\nNew skills you will practice with this exercise include:\n\n-   Using non-spatial joins for data frames\n-   Computing geometric measurements\n-   Using spatial filters\n-   Using geometric operations on a simple feature geometry set\n-   Using geometric operations on pairs of simple feature geometries\n\n## Setup\n\nThis exercise uses the `sf` and `tidyverse` packages:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe are also going to use the `us_states` and `us_states_df` data from the `{spData}` package:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(spData)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that the `us_states` loaded for this exercise is different than the `us_states` we created during class with the `tigris::states()` function. For this exercise, the bonus exercises are mixed in with the other questions but you are welcome to skip them if you do not want go for the bonus part of the exercise.\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Filtering data\n\nFind all states that belong to the West region, have an area below 250,000 km2and in 2015 a population greater than 5,000,000 residents (**Hint:** you may need to use the function `units::set_units()` or `as.numeric()`).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFind all states that belong to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km2 or a total population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Joining and summarizing data\n\nWhat was the total population in 2015 in the `us_states` dataset?

How many of these high points does the Canterbury region contain?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncanterbury <- nz |>\n  filter(Name == \"Canterbury\")\n\nnz_height |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Bonus:** plot the result using the `ggplot2::geom_sf()` function to show all of New Zealand, `canterbury` region highlighted in yellow, high points in Canterbury represented by red crosses (**Hint:** try using `shape = 7`) and high points in other parts of New Zealand represented by blue circles.\n\nSee the help page `?ggplot2::shape` and run the examples to see an illustration of different `shape` values.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhich region has the second highest number of `nz_height` points, and how many does it have?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnz_height |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nGeneralizing the question to all regions: how many of New Zealand's 16 regions contain points which belong to the top 100 highest points in the country? Which regions?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Bonus:** create a table listing these regions in order of the number of points and their name. Hint: use `dplyr::slice_max()` and `gt::gt()`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUsing [`st_buffer()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html), how many points in `nz_height` are within 100 km of Canterbury?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnz_height |> \n  st_buffer(____, dist = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Spatial predicates\n\nTest your knowledge of spatial predicates by finding out and plotting how US states relate to each other and other spatial objects.\n\nThe starting point of this part of the exercise is to create an object representing Maryland state in the USA using the [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) function and plot the resulting object in the context of US states.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmaryland <- filter(____, ____)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = us_states) +\n  geom_sf(data = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new object representing all the states that geographically intersect with Maryland and plot the result (hint: the most concise way to do this is with the subsetting method `[` but you can also use `sf::st_filter()`).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstates_intersecting_md <- ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCreate another object representing all the objects that touch (have a shared boundary with) Maryland and plot the result (hint: remember you can use the argument `op = st_intersects` when subsetting with base R or `.predicate = st_intersects` when using `st_filter()`).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstates_touching_md <- ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Bonus:** create a straight line from the centroid of Maryland to the centroid of California near the West coast of the USA (hint: functions [`st_centroid()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html), [`st_union()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_combine.html) and [`st_cast()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_cast.html) described in Chapter 5 may help) and identify which states this long East-West line crosses.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHow far is the geographic centroid of Maryland from the geographic centroid of Canterbury, New Zealand?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the length of the boundary lines of US states in meters. Which state has the longest border and which has the shortest? **Hint:** The `st_length` function computes the length of a `LINESTRING` or `MULTILINESTRING` geometry.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n",
