These exercises build on our last exercise using `{dplyr}` and include some of the same skills including:\n\n- Filtering or subsetting rows using attributes\n\nNew skills you will practice with this exercise include:\n\n- Working with `unit` class attributes (columns)\n- Joining datasets\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are also going to use the `us_states` and `us_states_df` data from the `{spData}` package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(spData)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Searching for `us_states`\n\nFind all states with the following characteristics (bonus find and plot\nthem):\n\nBelong to the Midwest region.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelong to the West region, have an area below 250,000 km2and in 2015 a\npopulation greater than 5,000,000 residents (hint: you may need to use\nthe function `units::set_units()` or `as.numeric()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelong to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km2 or a\ntotal population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat was the total population in 2015 in the `us_states` dataset? What\nwas the minimum and maximum total population in 2015?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Comparing and summarizing data\n\nAdd variables from `us_states_df` to `us_states`, and create a new\nobject called `us_states_stats`.\n\n-   What function did you use and why?\n-   Which variable is the key in both datasets?\n-   What is the class of the new object?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_states_stats <- us_states |> \n  ____\n```\n:::\n\n\n`us_states_df` has two more rows than `us_states`. **How can you find\nthem?**\n\nHint: try to use the `dplyr::anti_join()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n____(us_states, us_states_df)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**How much has population density changed between 2010 and 2015 in each\nstate?**\n\nCalculate the change in percentages and map them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nCalculate the change in the number of residents living below the poverty level between 2010 and 2015 for each state. (Hint: See `?us_states_df` for documentation on the poverty level columns.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nBonus: Calculate the change in the percentage of residents living below the poverty level in each state.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat was the minimum, average and maximum state’s number of people living below the poverty line in 2015 for each region?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nBonus: What is the region with the largest increase in people living below the poverty line?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
