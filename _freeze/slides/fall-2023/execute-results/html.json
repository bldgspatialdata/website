When an error tells you it has `no applicable method` for a specific input—you may be passing a different object than you think you are. \n\n### Lecture\n\n🖥️ [Exploratory data analysis](/slides/exploratory-analysis.html)\n\n### Questions on tidy data\n\n**After you tidy data, where or how do you start looking in order to make sense of it?**\n\n### Questions on Quarto\n\n**Why did Quarto render a bunch of figures from the quarto md files of exercises due in previous weeks?**\n\n**How do you duplicate of a Quarto document?**\n\n### Questions on functions\n\n**Is there a way to embed a function within one another?**\n\nYes! You can define a function within a function like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_fn <- function(...) {\n  embedded_fn <- function(..., collapse = \",\") {\n    paste0(..., collapse = collapse)\n  }\n\n  embedded_fn(...)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can also use [anonymous functions and shortcuts](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html#purrr-shortcuts) (especially inside of tidyverse functions that translate the \"tilde\" formula style notation into a function):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dbl(mtcars, \\(x){\n  length(unique(x))\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb \n  25    3   27   22   22   29   30    2    2    3    6 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap_dbl(mtcars, ~ length(unique(.x)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb \n  25    3   27   22   22   29   30    2    2    3    6 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Is there any set of naming convention for functions that most people use?**\n\nUse what the function *does* as a guide.\n\nTry an `object_verb()` naming scheme for functions take a common data type or interact with a common API where `object` refers to the data/API and `verb` the primary action. (see the [Function and argument](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#function-and-argument-naming) recommendations in the[ Packaging Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html) section of the [rOpenSci Packages](https://devguide.ropensci.org/index.html) book)\n\nFor example:\n\n- **stringi**, functions starting with `stri_` manipulate strings (`stri_join()`, `stri_sort()`\n- **googlesheets** functions starting with `gs_` are calls to the Google Sheets API `gs_auth()`, `gs_user()`, `gs_download()`\n\n----\n\n**When creating a function is there a way to save it to your R project so if you were to start a new script document you can still use the function?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**How do we create a data frame and store the output from a function in a data frame?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**What are the advantages of using `return()` over using nested logic (e.g. `if (...) { } else { }`) when writing functions?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**How do we determine these thresholds for other variables in different datasets?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**If the list of our arguments/inputs are column values from a data frame, how do we call the entire list of our arguments/inputs from that data frame after the function executes?**\n\n\n## Week 7: October 11, 2023\n\nThese past updates are in reverse chronological order.\n\n### Due this week\n\n* Exercise 6 is due this Friday!\n* Readings on scripts, functions, and Quarto. \n\n### Due next week\n\n* Make a mapping function and use it in a Quarto document!\n\n### Your interesting things!\n\n----\n\nThe reasoning behind why sometimes you can use pipes and sometimes not finally clicked with me! I had been trying to use pipes for everything and didn't understand why it wasn't working -- getting that down was really helpful.\n\n----\n\nI have found that it super interesting to determine how to tidy data, like taking the time to make logical sense of the data is great but this also leads to what I find most difficult.\n\n----\n\nI really enjoyed the independence of going out and located are own data and being able to manipulate it in R. Feels like the first step into the real world.\n\n----\n\nJoining is just *so much easier* in R as opposed to ArcGIS or QGIS.\n\n----\n\n### Your difficult things\n\nOne of the most challenging concepts or topics for me from all the syllabus covered till now is the `st_()` functions.\n\nThere are a lot of geometry operations and each has a different set of parameters and features, which are mostly confusing.\n\n### Your questions\n\n#### Trouble-shooting code questions\n\nWhy does `plot()` make 6 maps instead of 1?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmaryland <- us_states |>\n  select(NAME) |>\n  filter(NAME == \"Maryland\")\n\nstates_intersecting_md <- st_filter(\n  us_states,\n  maryland,\n  .predicate = st_intersects\n)\n\nplot(states_intersecting_md)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](fall-2023_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n----\n\nWhy does this not work?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = states_intersecting_md,\n  mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat)\n) +\n  geom_sf()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `geom_sf()`:\n! Problem while computing aesthetics.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error:\n! object 'long' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n----\n\nWhat is `stringr::str_flatten()` doing?\n\n`str_flatten()` reduces a character vector to a single string.\n\nThis is a **summary function** because regardless of the length of the input `x`, it always returns a single string.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncommas <- function(x) {\n  str_flatten(x, collapse = \", \", last = \" and \")\n}\n\ncommas(c(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"pigeon\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"cat, dog and pigeon\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n----\n\n#### Questions about finding and citing data\n\nIs there a large list or repository of good places to find data or is it more of a treasure hunt?\n\nHere is [a big list of possible data sources](https://bldgspatialdata.github.io/website/resources/data-sources.html) including local and national data sources and a set of R packages focused on data access. Many libraries create similar resources for students and researchers to use and some libraries have geospatial data specialists who can assist you in a search.\n\nThere are also a wide variety of scientific data repositories that are typically specific to a domain of research, community of practice, or institution. For example, take a look at this [NIH directory of 130+ data respositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) or the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository](https://edirepository.org/) used by the long-running Baltimore Ecosystem Study.\n\n---\n\nAre there more sources for *untidy* data? Are there any purposely untidy to be used for tidying practice?\n\nIt turns out there is a [package dedicated to sharing a selection of untidy datasets](https://github.com/kwstat/untidydata2)!\n\n`{tidyr}` also comes with a set of tiny practice datasets (`table1`, `table2`, `table3`, `table4a`, `table4b`, `table5`) for practicing these skills. These [slides from Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/course-materials/_slides/u2-d09-tidying/u2-d09-tidying#1) or the [accompanying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3KM5uxaFdI) are good resources to review the basics of using the `pivot_` and `separate_` function families to change the strcture of your data.\n\n----\n\nWhat is the best approach for proper citation and credit for data if there is no metadata and it is not clear who created it?\n\nCreate a citation with as much information as you have available using a citation manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). But, also reflect: if you don't know who created the data or how they created the data, should you be *using* the data?\n\n#### Questions about data formats\n\nWhat are the advantages or disadvantages of working with CSV files vs. GeoJSON files vs. other file types?\n\n----\n\nHow do I access data using a Feature Service URL?\n\n<https://services1.arcgis.com/UWYHeuuJISiGmgXx/arcgis/rest/services/CustomerServiceRequest_Prod/FeatureServer/0>\n\n#### Questions about working with Quarto\n\n\nCan use the RStudio debugging tools for code blocks in a `.qmd` file (Quarto document)?\n\nNot really. You could keep your code in one or more R scripts that you can then source into your Quarto document. Or you could extract your code chunks into a R script using the `knitr::purl()` function (for de-bugging purposes only or to use as a source for the document).\n\n----\n\nWhat is the keyboard shortcut to delete empty code chunks?\n\nIt doesn't exist (although it was proposed [via GitHub issue back in November 2021](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/10147)).
