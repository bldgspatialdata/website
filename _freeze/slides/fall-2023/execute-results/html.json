Review\nthe reading [on the filter\nfunction](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#filter) or check out\nthis optional section of R for Data Science on [boolean operations with\nstrings](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps#sec-boolean-operations).\n\n----\n\n**How do you set `{tidyselect}` helpers to be case *insensitive*?**\n\n[Check out the\ndocumentation](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/starts_with.html)!\nLook for the `ignore.case` parameter.\n\n----\n\n\"I would love to run through the code for this bar graph in class, since\nI don't totally understand what thought process to use to come up with\nit.\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights |>\n  replace_na(\n    replace = list(arr_delay = 0)\n  ) |> \n  mutate(\n    hour_factor = factor(hour),\n    arr_delay_flag = arr_delay > 5\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = hour_factor, fill = arr_delay_flag)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Interesting things\n\nWe all love `filter()`! We also appreciate `distinct()`\n\n----\n\n\"I have been working with R for a while now, in classes and for my own\nresearch. The lecture this week and the exercise really helped me\nunderstand the application of all the tools to transform data, which was\nsuper interesting because I often end up doing selections and filters in\nArcGIS Pro or in a csv.\"\n\n### Difficult things\n\n**Answering this question:** Which carrier has the worst average delays?\n**Challenge:** can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad\ncarriers? Why/why not?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# flights |>\n#   replace_na(\n#     replace = list(\n#       arr_delay = 0,\n#       dep_delay = 0\n#     )\n#   ) |>\n#   summarise(\n#     n_flights = n(),\n#     n_delay_flights = sum(n > dep_delay),\n#     mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),\n#     mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),\n#     mean_total_delay = mean(arr_delay + dep_delay),\n#     .by = carrier\n#   ) |>\n#   slice_max(order_by = mean_total_delay, n = 10)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights |>\n  replace_na(\n    replace = list(\n      arr_delay = 0,\n      dep_delay = 0\n    )\n  ) |>\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),\n    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),\n    mean_total_delay_diff = mean(dep_delay - arr_delay),\n    mean_total_delay = mean(dep_delay + arr_delay),\n    .by = carrier\n  ) |>\n  arrange(desc(mean_total_delay))\n```\n:::\n\n\n----\n\n### What is due by this week\n\n-   Complete required readings for [week 4](../weeks/week_04.html)\n-   Submit [response to weekly check-in\n    questions](https://forms.gle/PAKvmQX652e5Eois6)\n-   Complete [Exercise 3](../exercises/exercise_03.html) on `{dplyr}`\n\n### What is coming up for next week\n\n-   Complete required readings for [week 5](../weeks/week_05.html)\n-   Submit [response to weekly check-in\n    questions](https://forms.gle/PAKvmQX652e5Eois6)\n-   Complete [Exercise 4](../exercises/exercise_03.html) on `{sf}` and\n    `{dplyr}` (and a little `{tidyr}`)\n\n# Upcoming Updates\n\n## Week 5: September 27, 2023\n\n## Week 6: October 4, 2023\n\n## Week 7: October 11, 2023\n\n## Week 8: October 18, 2023\n\n## Week 9: October 25, 2023\n\n## Week 10: November 1, 2023\n\n## Week 11: November 8, 2023\n\n## Week 12: November 15, 2023\n\n## Week 13: November 22, 2023\n\n## Week 14: November 29, 2023\n\n## Week 15: December 6, 2023\n\n# Past Updates\n\nThese past updates are in reverse chronological order.\n\n## Week 3: September 13, 2023\n\n### What is due by this week\n\n-   Complete required readings for [week 3](../weeks/week_03.html)\n-   Submit [response to weekly check-in\n    questions](https://forms.gle/PAKvmQX652e5Eois6)\n-   Complete [Exercise 2](../exercises/exercise_02.html) on `{ggplot2}`\n\n### What is coming up for next week\n\n-   Complete required readings for [week 4](../weeks/week_04.html)\n-   Submit [response to weekly check-in\n    questions](https://forms.gle/PAKvmQX652e5Eois6)\n-   Complete [Exercise 3](../exercises/exercise_03.html) on `{dplyr}`\n    and `{tidyr}`\n\n### Before we start this week\n\n-   I want to set up reminders for due dates.

What is the difference between raster and\n    vector tiles?\n-   What does the function `ggplot2::aes()` and the attributes passed to\n    the function really do?\n-   Do you need to re-install your packages every time you start work?\n\nReminder: questions are *required* as part of the weekly check-in.\n\n## Week 1: September 6, 2023\n\n-   Welcome!\n\n### What is due by this week\n\n-   Join the Discord chat\n",
