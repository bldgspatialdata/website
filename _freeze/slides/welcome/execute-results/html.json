Weekly check-in\n2.  Practice exercises\n3.  Final project\n\n### Weekly check-in 📝\n\n-   The goal of the weekly check-in is to help you stay on top of the reading and get your questions out for everyone to benefit from.\n\n### Practice exercises 🛠️\n\n<!-- FIXME: Are practice exercises optional or required? How wiill they be graded? -->\n-   Each practice exercise will include a mix of questions and coding prompts excerpted or adapted from R for Data Science, Geocomputation with R, and other resources.\n\n-   Questions may include both close-ended \"fill in the blank\" style questions and more open-ended prompts.\n\n-   Feedback on the exercises is welcome!\n\n<!--\n### Final project\n\nThe final project includes a few elements:\n\n-   A proposal\n-   A presentation\n-   A reproducible project repository\n\nThe proposal and presentation will both be built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) using the [HTML document](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and [Reveal.js presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) formats.\n-->\n<!-- FIXME: What is happening with the final project? -->\n\n## Readings 📚\n\n-   What are the readings?\n-   What is the difference between required and optional readings?\n-   How can you get the most out of the readings?\n\n### R for Data Science\n\n![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/cover.jpg)\n\n### Geocomputation with R\n\n![](images/book_cover_r2.jpg)\n\n::: footer\nNote that this book also includes extensive information on raster data. This is *not* a topic covered in any detail as part of this class and can be skipped.\n:::\n\n### Other readings and resources\n\n- Vignettes and other R package documentation\n- Recorded presentations\n- Journal articles\n\n<!-- ### All Data are Local\n\n![](https://mit-press-us.imgix.net/covers/9780262545174.jpg?auto=format&w=298&dpr=2&q=20) -->\n\n### Required vs. Optional\n\n- Optional readings may include whole books or websites. These are recommended if you are interested in learning more about a topic—but may be infeasible\n\n### Getting the most out of readings\n\nTake notes on questions or observations while you reading. Use these notes to submit your weekly check-in.\n\nReadings on coding in R should be done at a computer with RStudio open. Try re-typing code from the text into RStudio and running the code to see how it works.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n### What can you expect during class\n\n### Make this a safe and mutually supportive space\n\nWe are all learning! No prior programming experience is required and we should all work to make this an inclusive experienced for everyone.\n\n### Attendance and remote participation\n\n**Do come to class.** You'll get the most out of this semester if you are present and participating.\n\n**Don't come to class sick!** Please prioritize your health and well-being if you are sick or need to care for someone else.\n\nYou *can* participate online if you need to. We can screen share sessions to Discord and record lectures if needed.\n\n### Using ChatGPT or other LLMs\n\n-   You *are* strongly discouraged from using ChatGPT, Claude, or other large language models to help with your project or, if desired, assignments.\n\n-   You *must* include information about when and how you use it including your specific prompts and tools used.\n\n-   You *should* use these tools with caution. They provide non-working code and describe non-existent functions and packages. Don't let this tool stand in the way of developing your own understanding of R and how it works.\n\n## Welcome again!\n",
