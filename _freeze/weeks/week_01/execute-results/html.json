Get started with spatial data using `{sf}` and the tidyverse.\"\nimage: /slides/images/allison-horst_sf-illustration.jpeg\nshow_review: false\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nWelcome to Building Spatial Datasets!\n\nOur first session starts with a general introduction to the course and a hands-on introduction to using R for working with spatial data.\n\n### Key Objectives\n\n-   Provide an overview of the scope and schedule of the course\n-   Introduce the concept of **reproducibility** and key reproducible practices for data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, and tracking work\n-   Configure RStudio and create a RStudio project\n-   Introduce the concept of **simple features** and how the concept is implemented by the `{sf}` package\n-   Create a Quarto document to practice using the `{tidyverse}` and `{sf}` package\n\n### Key Skills\n\n-   Creating self-contained projects with RStudio\n-   Installing packages with `install.packages()`\n-   Loading packages with `library()`\n-   Using the `?` operator to look up function documentation\n-   Using `str()` or `View()` to look at an object\n-   Using an assignment operator (`<-` or `=`) to save an output to a new object\n-   Creating and editing Quarto documents with RStudio\n-   Using `sf::st_read()` to read a `sf` object from a file path or URL\n\n## Prepare\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"true\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Getting ready for the first class\n\n- [ ] Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer. If you already have R installed, please check to make sure your installation is up to date. For more details, check out [the Prerequisites section from R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites) (one of a few books we'll use in our class).\n\n- [ ] [Sign up for a GitHub user account](https://github.com/signup). I use GitHub to distribute assignments and you will use GitHub to submit assignments. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) is one of the most popular platform for collaborative coding and makes using Git for version control easier. People use GitHub for everything from writing R packages to textbooks!\n\n- [ ] Install Git on your computer. One easy option is to [install the GitHub Desktop application](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (which installs Git at the same time). Alternatively, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) details a few different ways to [download and install](https://git-scm.com/install/) Git on Windows, OSX, or Linux.\n\n- [ ] [Join our course Discord](https://discord.gg/k7JkwD6R). I use Discord to share class announcements and encourage students to use the Discord to share links and questions throughout the semester.\n\n- [ ] [Complete the student survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRg0oOK9y50PrwhRAvux0-ANVvi6vkeebATHX9iH4Lia5fbA/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is how you share your GitHub username. I'd also love to know more about what experiences you're bringing to the class and what you hope to learn.\n\n- [ ] If you have not done any programming before, I recommend taking some time to review [The Very Basics](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html) and [Packages and Help Pages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) (section 2 and 3 from [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)).\n:::\n\n### Required readings\n\n-   [Ch. 1 Introduction](https://r.geocompx.org/intro) in @lovelaceGeocomputation2025\n-   [Ch. 2 Geographic data in R](https://r.geocompx.org/spatial-class) in @lovelaceGeocomputation2025\n<!-- -   [Ch. 3 Workflow: basics](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics) in @wickhamDataScienceImport2023 -->\n-   @brunsdonOpeningPracticeSupporting2021\n<!-- -   @wilsonGoodEnoughPractices2017 -->\n\n### Optional resources\n\nAdditional readings on working with spatial data in R:\n\n-   [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/index.html) (Data Carpentry)\n-   [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) (Data Carpentry)\n-   [Ch. 3 Geometries](https://r-spatial.org/book/03-Geometries.html) in @pebesmaSpatialDataScience2023\n\nAdditional readings on reproducible practices:\n\n-   @bryanHowNameFiles2015 (or the more recent recorded talk [How to name files talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1LTlnpLMk) for NormConf 2022)\n\n\n## Participate\n\n🖥️ [Welcome to GES 668](/slides/welcome.qmd)\n\n🖥️ [Introduction to Spatial Data with R](/slides/{{< var slides.week_1 >}})\n\n## Practice\n\n🛠️️ [Exercise 0{{< meta order >}}](/exercises/exercise_0{{< meta order >}}.qmd)\n\n<!--\n### Review\n\nHere is a quick summary of what we learned this week:\n\n-   How the RStudio IDE interface is organized around a console, help pane, source pane, and environment pane (check out the [RStudio IDE Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf) for a quick reference)\n-   How functions start with inputs (also known as arguments or parameters), produce side effects (e.g. informational messages), and return outputs (e.g. a character string or a `sf` object)\n-   How `sf` objects are structured around attributes and geometries\n- How R code is executed within a development environment where packages or objects are loaded\n-   How and when to restart an R session to reset the environment\n\nHere are a few questions for additional reflection:\n\n-   How does coding in R or other languages support reproducible spatial data analysis?\n-   Why use R for working with spatial data?\n\n-->\n",
