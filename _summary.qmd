In this course, students learn how to look critically at spatial data and use the R programming language to transform, visualize, and create spatial datasets. Working with open-source tools, reproducible methods, and real world data, students develop skills in the fundamentals of reading and wrangling spatial data with the [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [tidyverse family](https://www.tidyverse.org/) of R packages.
