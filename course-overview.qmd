title: "GES668: Building Spatial Datasets"
---

In this course, students learn how to access and understand spatial data using the R programming language and the [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [tidyverse family](https://www.tidyverse.org/) of R packages. Working with open-source tools, reproducible methods, and real world data, students develop skills in the fundamentals of reading and wrangling spatial data.

Readings and practical exercise prepare students to build and maintain data sets about local places and navigate critical issues including data ownership, accuracy, and privacy considerations.
