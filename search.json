    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for this course includes three parts:\n\nweekly check-ins,\npractice exercises,\nand a final project\n\n\nWeekly check-ins\nEach week students are expected to submit a brief written check-in based on the assigned readings and exercises. Your check-in should answer three questions:\n\nWhat did you find most interesting this week?\nWhat did you find most difficult this week?\nWhat is one question you have about the readings or exercise?\n\nYour check-in response should be submitted via Google Forms before the start of each class session. You are also encouraged but not required to post your question to the class Discord where other students are able to reply. Partial credit will be awarded for incomplete check-in responses.\nStudents are expected to submit at least 10 weekly check-in responses during the term so may skip up to 5 check-in responses without penalty. Weekly check-in assignments must be submitted before 11:59 am on the day before each class session. No late responses will be accepted for the weekly check-in.\n\n\nPractice exercises\nThese exercises give you an opportunity to practice the application of concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, labs should be completed and submitted individually.\nExercises are graded based on completion—so an effort to attempt all parts of the exercise will be awarded full credit. Some assignments may also include a bonus objective. An assignment with less than 80% of questions attempted will be considered incomplete. Incomplete assignments can be revised and resubmitted for full credit within a week of a student receiving my feedback.\n\n3: Assignment is submitted, complete, and includes a complete bonus objective\n2: Assignment is submitted and complete\n1: Assignment is submitted but incomplete\n0: Assignment not submitted\n\nStudents are expected to submit at least 10 exercises during the term so may skip up to 2 exercises without penalty. Practice exercises are due the Monday before each class session. For example, the first exercise is introduced on Wednesday, August 30 and should be completed by 11:59 PM on Monday, September 4.\n\n\nFinal project\nAll students will participate in a final project that can be completed independently or in collaboration with other students in the class. The project must use data from:\n\nOpenStreetMap (accessed with the {osmdata} package),\nAmerican Community Survey data (accessed with the {tidycensus} package),\nor a combination of these and other sources.\n\nThe final project is an opportunity for students to focus on the “models of local practice” described in All Data Are Local—with a special focus on how we can “make place part of data presentation.” Typically, the final project should fit into one of two categories:\n\nA data visualization or interactive that uses the data to tell a story or prompt reflection\nAn exploratory data analysis that uses the data to ask or answer questions\n\n\n\nKey dates and deliverables\nThe assessment of the project is based on four parts:\n\nA project proposal (1-2 pages in length) must be submitted by November 7.\nPeer feedback on two other proposals completed by November 14.\nAn project presentation delivered in-class on December 6.\nA project GitHub repository completed by December 14.\n\nEvaluation of the final project will be based on both self-assessment by the individual student or group and an instructor assessment. The instructor can also offer bonus points in recognition of exceptional work or, if necessary, adjust points awarded through the student self-assessment.\n\n\nGrading\nAssessment in this course is intended to help you focus on completing assignments and keeping up with the material—not getting everything perfect along the way.\nYou can earn up to a total of 100 points in this class by submitting at least 10 weekly check-ins (30 points), completing 10 exercises (20 points), and completing all four parts of the final project (50 points).\n\n\n\nAssessment\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nWeekly questions\n30\n\n\nPractice exercises\n20\n\n\nFinal project\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n10\n\n\nPeer feedback on two project proposals\n10\n\n\nPresentation\n10\n\n\nProject repository\n20"

    "text": "3 Complete the week’s exercise\nThe process for completing will be mostly the same for each week of the class.\n\n3.1 Locating the week’s exericse file\n\nLocate the “_/exercises” folder on your computer.\nOpen the exercises.RProj file in RStudio. Review the documentation on managing projects in RStudio or the R for Data Science chapter on working with projects for more background on why projects are useful.\nUsing the “Files” tab pane, locate the exercise_01.qmd file (or the number exercise file for this week) and open it. The file extension (.qmd) is short for Quarto Markdown document.\nIf you can’t find this week’s exercise file, you may have forgotten to update the repository. Go back and check Section 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Quarto document?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Quarto document is a format that lets you mix “chunks” of R code with sections of text formatted using the Markdown formatting conventions. It is similar to an older format known as RMarkdown (.Rmd). Quarto comes installed with RStudio but it is a separate command line application that can turn a qmd document into a standalone website, a formatted PDF, a presentation, and more. This course website, for example, is built with Quarto.\nYou can see that a front matter section at the top of each document. This front matter (also known as YAML) controls the format, appearance, and content of the rendered document.\nThe Hello, Quarto tutorial is a great place to learn how to render Quarto documents, run code chunks interactively, and format text using the markdown syntax.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the project by filling in the blank spaces, fixing any “broken” code in the document, or adding new code in the “code chunks” that look like this:\n\n\n1 + 1 # example code\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Running code and writing responses to the exercise prompts\n\nTry executing the code in each chunk as you work through the practice exercise. The results from the code appear right below the chunk. If you get an error or a warning, try to use that information as a clue to figure out what you need to change.\nWhen you are done with the exercise, there should be no more blank spaces like this one: ____. The bonus exercises are optional but otherwise any code chunk that started empty should now have code inside. Some questions require short written responses which should be included above or below the code chunks—not inside!\nIf all of your code chunks run smoothly, you should be able to “render” the .qmd document to create a new HTML document. When I review completed assignments, trying to render the document will always be my first step.\nRemember, you don’t need to get everything right and it is OK if your document won’t render. Just try your best with each part of the exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for completing exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete this exercise from top to bottom. Some later chunks of code may depend on an earlier chunk so avoid skipping around.\nIf you get an error message, read it. If it doesn’t make sense, try looking it up. R for Data Science reminds readers that Google is your friend.\nRead the documentation!"

    "text": "4 Committing your completed exercise to the repository\nYou may have saved your updated document to your computer but the last step is to save or “commit” those changes to the exercise repository.\n“Committing” your changes and syncing the changes with the remote version of your repository on GitHub allows me to see your completed exercise and share feedback on your work.\n\n4.1 Commit changes with GitHub Desktop\nThe first and easiest way to commit changes is using GitHub Desktop.\n\nReview the GitHub documentation on Committing and reviewing changes to your project in GitHub Desktop for more detailed instructions.\n\n\n\n4.2 Commit changes with RStudio\nThe second way to commit changes is using the Git tab within RStudio. The interface for Git within RStudio is a little less friendly but is a convenient option since you don’t need to leave RStudio to commit your changes.\nHere is the step-by-step process (adapted from Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub in Happy Git and GitHub for the useR):\n\nClick the “Git” tab in upper right pane.\nCheck “Staged” box for exercise_01.qmd.\nIf you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”.\nType a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”.\nClick “Commit”.\nFinally, click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should you commit your changes?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to wait until you are 100% finished with the exercise to commit your changes. You may want to commit the changes every time you work on the exercise. Please make sure to change the “status” for the exercise from “Available” to “Complete” when your exercise is complete and ready for evaluation. I will typically evaluate the last week’s exercises on the Tuesday before each class session."

If they aren’t installed, install them now using {pak} (a faster option than install.packages()).\nCopy the following lines (without the # character) into the console to install all three packages (don’t forget to restart your session afterwards):\n\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\n# pak::pkg_install(c(\"mapview\", \"spData\"))\n\nThis week’s exercise is mostly “fill in the blank” questions and coding exercises.

This is a named character vector:\n\nnames(c(\"A\" = \"apple\"))\n\nA sf object is a data.frame but it also has a special sf class that is designed to implement the formal simple features standard in R:\n\nclass(nc)\n\nAs a data frame, a sf object has column names (which you can access with names() or colnames()):\n\ncolnames(nc)\n\n\nNext, use class() to check the class of the output from st_geometry():\n\nnc_geometry &lt;- st_geometry(nc)\n\n____\n\nThis object is a special type of list. You can subset one or more items from a list using a single or double set of square brackets like this:\n\nnc_geometry[1]\n\nnc_geometry[[1]]\n\nTake a look at the attributes for this list using attributes():\n\n____(nc_geometry)\n\nNow, use class() one more time to find out what type of objects make up nc_geometry:\n\n____(nc_geometry[[1]])\n\n\nsummary() is another way to get information about names and attributes all at once. Try using summary() on nc_geometry:\n\nsummary(____)\n\nReview the results and try to answer the following:\n\nWhat is the geometry type? ____\nWhat is the coordinate reference system? ____\nHow many features? ____\n\n\n\n2.4 Visualize sf objects\nSome packages come with data we can use as soon as the package is loaded.\nLoad the {spData} packages using library() then make a plot of the us_states data:\n\nlibrary(____)\n\nplot(____)\n\nCan you use plot() to make a map of states color-coded by region?\n\nplot(____)\n\nCan you make a map of us_states using ggplot() and geom_sf()?\n\nggplot(data = ____) +\n  geom_sf()\n\nCan you make a map us_states you made with geom_sf() and have states are color-coded by total population in 2015?\n\nggplot(data = ____) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = ____))\n\nTake a look at the documentation for ggplot2::geom_sf() for examples if you get stuck. You can also use names() or summary() with us_states to find out the column names of the different attributes."

The data is published as an ArcGIS Feature Layer (a type of Web Map Service or WMS). The service allows us to access the data in a few different formats including as a GeoJSON file.\nI went ahead and pulled the URL to use for this exercise and got it ready to read with sf by pasting on a “vsicurl” prefix. This prefix tells GDAL (the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) to use a virtual file system that allows sf to use a URL for a spatial data file as a data source.\n\ndsn &lt;- \"https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_Transit/FeatureServer/9/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson\"\n\ndsn &lt;- paste0(\"/vsicurl/\" , dsn)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout GDAL and other sf dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nGDAL is one of the major open source projects that “powers” the {sf} package along with GEOS, PROJ, and udunits2. Geocomputation with R explains these dependencies:\n\nGDAL, for reading, writing and manipulating a wide range of geographic data formats,\nPROJ, a powerful library for coordinate system transformations\nGEOS, a planar geometry engine for operations such as calculating buffers and centroids on data with a projected CRS\nS2, a spherical geometry engine written in C++ developed by Google\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine st_read() and the assignment operator &lt;- to read the URL and create a new sf object:\n\nbus_stops ____ ____\n\n\nLoad the {mapview} library and then use the mapview() function to create an interactive map of the new bus_stops object:\n\n____\n\n____\n\nExplore the documentation for mapview() by running ?mapview::mapview in your console. Read the help page to see how you can customize your interactive map.\nIf you want a guided tour of the package, check out this recorded 2020 tutorial on YouTube with Tim Appelhans (who created mapview in 2016 with grant support from the R Consortium).\nCan you create another interactive map that is color-coded by one of the attributes in bus_stops?\n\n_____"
