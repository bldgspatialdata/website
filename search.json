    "text": "2 What is R?\n\n\nR is best known for as a statistical programming language often used in data science and research.\nLike Python or C++, R is an object-oriented, functional programming language where the base set of features can be extended through open-source packages or libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA package is a bundle of code that a generous person has written, tested, and then given away. Most of the time packages are designed to solve a specific problem, so they to pull together functions related to a particular data science problem (e.g., data wrangling, visualisation, inference).\n\nFrom BasicBasics 2 (R-Ladies Sydney)"

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for this course includes three parts:\n\nweekly check-ins,\npractice exercises,\nand a final project\n\n\nWeekly check-ins\nEach week students are expected to submit a brief written check-in based on the assigned readings and exercises. Your check-in should answer three questions:\n\nWhat did you find most interesting this week?\nWhat did you find most difficult this week?\nWhat is one question you have about the readings or exercise?\n\nYour check-in response should be submitted via Google Forms before the start of each class session. You are also encouraged but not required to post your question to the class Discord where other students are able to reply. Partial credit will be awarded for incomplete check-in responses.\nStudents are expected to submit at least 10 weekly check-in responses during the term so may skip up to 5 check-in responses without penalty. Weekly check-in assignments must be submitted before 11:59 am on the day before each class session. No late responses will be accepted for the weekly check-in.\n\n\nPractice exercises\nThese exercises give you an opportunity to practice the application of concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, labs should be completed and submitted individually.\nExercises are graded based on completion‚Äîso an effort to attempt all parts of the exercise will be awarded full credit. Some assignments may also include a bonus objective. An assignment with less than 80% of questions attempted will be considered incomplete. Incomplete assignments can be revised and resubmitted for full credit within a week of a student receiving my feedback.\n\n3: Assignment is submitted, complete, and includes a complete bonus objective\n2: Assignment is submitted and complete\n1: Assignment is submitted but incomplete\n0: Assignment not submitted\n\nStudents are expected to submit at least 10 exercises during the term so may skip up to 2 exercises without penalty. Practice exercises are due the Monday before each class session. For example, the first exercise is introduced on Wednesday, August 30 and should be completed by 11:59 PM on Monday, September 4.\n\n\nFinal project\nAll students will participate in a final project that can be completed independently or in collaboration with other students in the class. The project must use data from:\n\nOpenStreetMap (accessed with the {osmdata} package),\nAmerican Community Survey data (accessed with the {tidycensus} package),\nor a combination of these and other sources.\n\nThe final project is an opportunity for students to focus on the ‚Äúmodels of local practice‚Äù described in All Data Are Local‚Äîwith a special focus on how we can ‚Äúmake place part of data presentation.‚Äù Typically, the final project should fit into one of two categories:\n\nA data visualization or interactive that uses the data to tell a story or prompt reflection\nAn exploratory data analysis that uses the data to ask or answer questions\n\n\n\nKey dates and deliverables\nThe assessment of the project is based on four parts:\n\nA project proposal (1-2 pages in length) must be submitted by November 7.\nPeer feedback on two other proposals completed by November 14.\nAn project presentation delivered in-class on December 6.\nA project GitHub repository completed by December 14.\n\nEvaluation of the final project will be based on both self-assessment by the individual student or group and an instructor assessment. The instructor can also offer bonus points in recognition of exceptional work or, if necessary, adjust points awarded through the student self-assessment.\n\n\nGrading\nAssessment in this course is intended to help you focus on completing assignments and keeping up with the material‚Äînot getting everything perfect along the way.\nYou can earn up to a total of 100 points in this class by submitting at least 10 weekly check-ins (30 points), completing 10 exercises (20 points), and completing all four parts of the final project (50 points).\n\n\n\nAssessment\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nWeekly questions\n30\n\n\nPractice exercises\n20\n\n\nFinal project\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n10\n\n\nPeer feedback on two project proposals\n10\n\n\nPresentation\n10\n\n\nProject repository\n20"

If you have any trouble with the next couple exercises, please review the chapter before continuing to the next section.\nWhy does this code not work?\n\nmy_variable &lt;- 10\nmy_varƒ±able\n\n\nTweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:\n\nlibary(todyverse)\n\nggplot(dTA = mpg) + \n  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm)\n\n\nPress ‚å• + ‚áß + K or ‚éá + ‚áß + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?\n\n\n\n2.2 Look up documentation\nThe ? is a function for accessing documentation on a function, dataset, or other topic. For example, executing the code: ?sf::st_read will pull up the documentation on functions to read simple features or layers from file or database.\nUse ? to access the documentation on sf::st_geometry() then look for the ‚ÄúValue‚Äù heading that provides information about the value returned by the function.\nWhat type of object does sf::st_geometry() return? Fill in the blank or paraphrase the description.\nsf::st_geometry() returns a ____ object.\nWhat is one other function documented on the same page? ____\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nReview Ch. 9 Workflow: getting help in R for Data Science (2e) for more information about getting help when you struggle with a package, function, or project.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Access object classes, names, and attributes\nThe class() and names() functions return basic information about an object in R.\nUse class() to check the class of the output from st_geometry():\n\nnc_geometry &lt;- st_geometry(nc)\n\n\nGet the names() for the nc object and the nc_geometry object:\n\nnames(____)\n\nnames(____)\n\nCan you explain the difference between the two results?\n\nsummary() can help get more information about an object.\nUse summary() on nc_geometry:\n\nsummary(____)\n\nReview the results and try to answer the following:\n\nWhat is the geometry type? ____\nWhat is the coordinate reference system? ____\nHow many features? ____\n\n\n\n2.4 Plot a sf object\nSome packages come with data we can use as soon as the package is loaded.\nLoad the {spData} packages using library() then make a plot of the us_states data:\n\nlibrary(____)\n\nplot(____)\n\nCan you update the plot of us_states to show a map of states by region?\n\nplot(____)\n\nCan you make a map of us_states using ggplot() and geom_sf()?\n\nggplot(data = ____) +\n  geom_sf()\n\nCan you update the map of us_states you made with geom_sf() so states are color-coded by total population in 2015? Take a look at the documentation for ggplot2::geom_sf() for examples.\n\nggplot(data = ____) +\n  geom_sf()\n\nIf you get stuck, try using names() or summary() to take a look at us_states to find out the column names for region or total population in 2015."
