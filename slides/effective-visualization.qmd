## Where to start?

-   Know your goal
-   Know your audience
-   Know your format

## What next?

-   Choosing appropriate graphic types
-   Writing and formatting clear text
-   Selecting appropriate and engaging colors
-   Preparing your feature geometry appropriately

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focus for today:

- Working with `theme()` (and custom theme packages like [hrbrthemes](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/)) to customize plot appearance
- Using [ragg](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) to use custom fonts with ggplot2
- Working with [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/) and `scale_` functions
- Working with the [new legends features](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/02/ggplot2-3-5-0-legends/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Choosing appropriate graphic types

-   What makes one graphic, chart, plot, or map "better" or "worse"?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What makes a bad map *bad*?

For new map makers who might not know any better, it is often:

-   Confusing or distracting layout
-   Not enough color contrast for features
-   Cluttered labels, legends, or features

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What makes a fine map *just* fine?

For more experienced map makers who might be in a hurry:

-   Not enough thought on font sizes and styling
-   No feature generalization (simplifying geometry where appropriate for the map scale or subject)
-   Inappropriate color scales

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many cartographic considerations that also apply to other all types of data visualization:

-   Layout
-   Fonts (Typography)
-   Colors
-   Output formats

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But there are also some cartographic considerations that apply to maps in special and important ways:

-   Feature geometry (and cartographic conventions)
-   Projections
-   Scaling

## Items, Attributes, Marks, and Channels

In [Visualization Analysis and Design](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) (2014), Tamara Munzner describes a set of useful concepts:

-   items,
-   attributes,
-   links,
-   marks,
-   and channels

## Items and Attributes

Items

:   basic units on which data is collected

Attributes

:   numerical or categorical features of the data items we want to represent

Links

:   relations among items, e.g. months within a year, or countries within a continent.

## Marks and Channels

Marks

:   geometric entities used to represent items: points, lines, areas.

Visual channels

:   features of marks that can be used to reflect values of attributes."
