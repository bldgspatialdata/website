## Week 5: September 27, 2023

### Your questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I get my own shapefiles into R?

```{r}
#| eval: false
path <- "path to your shapefile"

your_data <- read_sf(path)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there a "best" way to perform specific operations? Or does it depend
on individual preference?

There isn't a "best" way but there are often *better* and *worse* ways.
If you have more than one way to achieve the same objective in R, you
can compare the approaches using a few related considerations:

-   Performance (speed and memory)
-   Code readability
-   Consistency and predictability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This presentation on [Styling R
Code](https://wurli.github.io/r-styling/coffee-and-coding-styling-r-code.html)
from Jacob Scott is one of the best resources I've seen on the topic.

A few related resources:

-   `{lintr}` flags when it detects problems in your code.
-   `{styler}` can help automatically reformat your code.
-   Documentation like [the tidyverse style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) can inform how you write code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you keep track of what is happening when piping data from one
function to another?

The `{tidylog}` package is one tool for getting more insight into your
pipelines:

```{r}
library(tidylog, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

mtcars |> 
  filter(cyl == 4) |> 
  mutate(new_var = wt ** 2) |> 
  select(mpg, cyl, new_var)
```

Another is
[`{ViewPipeSteps}`](https://github.com/daranzolin/ViewPipeSteps)

The [debugging tools](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html) built into
R and RStudio can also be useful for trouble-shooting in case of errors
or unexpected results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between an intensive and extensive variable?

The concept of *intensive* or *extensive* variables comes to the world
of spatial data from physics and chemistry. The Wikipedia article on
[intensive and extensive
properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties)
provides helpful definitions:

-   an intensive property or intensive quantity is one whose magnitude
    is independent of the size of the system (e.g. temperature,
    hardness)

-   an extensive property or extensive quantity is one whose magnitude
    is additive for subsystems (e.g. mass, volume)

## Week 4: September 20, 2023

### Your questions

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/data-science/transform.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to filter multiple rows from a column?**

It all depends on the tests or conditions you pass to `filter()`. Review
the reading [on the filter
function](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#filter) or check out
this optional section of R for Data Science on [boolean operations with
strings](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps#sec-boolean-operations).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How do you set `{tidyselect}` helpers to be case *insensitive*?**

[Check out the
documentation](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/starts_with.html)!
Look for the `ignore.case` parameter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I would love to run through the code for this bar graph in class, since
I don't totally understand what thought process to use to come up with
it."

```{r}
flights |>
  replace_na(
    replace = list(arr_delay = 0)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    hour_factor = factor(hour),
    arr_delay_flag = arr_delay > 5
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_factor, fill = arr_delay_flag)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Interesting things

We all love `filter()`! We also appreciate `distinct()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I have been working with R for a while now, in classes and for my own
research. The lecture this week and the exercise really helped me
understand the application of all the tools to transform data, which was
super interesting because I often end up doing selections and filters in
ArcGIS Pro or in a csv."

### Difficult things

**Answering this question:** Which carrier has the worst average delays?
**Challenge:** can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad
carriers? Why/why not?

```{r}
# flights |>
#   replace_na(
#     replace = list(
#       arr_delay = 0,
#       dep_delay = 0
#     )
#   ) |>
#   summarise(
#     n_flights = n(),
#     n_delay_flights = sum(n > dep_delay),
#     mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
#     mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
#     mean_total_delay = mean(arr_delay + dep_delay),
#     .by = carrier
#   ) |>
#   slice_max(order_by = mean_total_delay, n = 10)
```

```{r}
flights |>
  replace_na(
    replace = list(
      arr_delay = 0,
      dep_delay = 0
    )
  ) |>
  summarise(
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
    mean_total_delay_diff = mean(dep_delay - arr_delay),
    mean_total_delay = mean(dep_delay + arr_delay),
    .by = carrier
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_total_delay))
```
