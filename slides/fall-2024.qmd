## Week 9

- Exercise 5 due next Friday, Nov. 1
- Office hours on Tuesday, Oct. 29
- Final project proposal due Wednesday, Nov. 13
- Lessons from McConchie and Boeing
- Open Street Map Lecture & Practice

### Lessons McConchie (2016)

McConchie introduces the concept of **map-gardening:** "the editing tasks that keep OSM going... the things that happen after that fun trailblazing phase of mapping all the streets in your neighborhood."

McConchie asks: "How do we make sure that OSM is a healthy community that has gardening, has people who enjoy maintenance?

### Lessons from Boeing (2020)

Why did Boeing make OSMnx open source? Making the tool open source:

-   "makes empirical work easier to review and reproduce."
-   "allows anyone else to contribute to the toolâ€™s ongoing development."
-   "empowers others working in urban science and planning to advance their empirical research on real-world spatial networks with a reusable, accessible, theoretically-sound tool."

Why did Boeing use OpenStreetMap data?

-   Google Maps data is unavailable (or un-affordable)
-   TIGER/Line roads shapefiles don't include topological details
-   Open Street Map is free and has global coverage

## Week 4

-   Exercise 2 solutions
-   Data transformation with dplyr
-   Parsons Problems

### Parsons Problems with {dplyr}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
  wind > 130
storms |>
filter(
library(dplyr)
  year == 2010,
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(dplyr)

storms |>
  filter(
    year == 2010,
    wind > 130
  )
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
slice_head(n = 10)
library(dplyr)
arrange(desc(wind_load)) |>
distinct(year, name, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
storms |>
mutate(wind_load = pressure * wind^2) |>
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

  arrange(desc(wind_load)) |>

```{r}

ggplot(aes(x = category, y = avg_wind)) +

summarise(avg_wind = mean(wind)) |>
library(tidyverse)
filter(!is.na(category)) |>
geom_point()
group_by(category) |>
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

  summarise(avg_wind = mean(wind)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = avg_wind)) +
  geom_point()
```
