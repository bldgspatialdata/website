## Overview

-   What is OpenStreetMap?
-   How do you contribute to OpenStreetMap?
-   How do you download data from OpenStreetMap?

These slides on OpenStreetMap and exploring OSM data with the `{osmdata}` package are based on a March 10, 2020 presentation by [Jonathan Dandois](https://twitter.com/jondandois) for MaptimeBmore and the CCBC GIS Capstone.

## What is OpenStreetMap?

-   Created in 2004 in response to restrictive data sharing by the UK [Ordnance Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ordnance-survey)

-   Grew as the "Wikipedia of maps" in response to increasing cost of commercial services like Google Maps after 2011 price hikes

## Using OpenStreetMap

![](images/umbc-area-open-street-map.png)

OpenStreetMap isn't just a map---it is a "**global geodatabase** of everything and anything that people add to the map":

-   roads, crosswalks, speed bumps, stop lights
-   restaurants, daycares, playgrounds, cannons
-   forests, central business districts, boundaries
-   land cover, gravestones, utility ROWs

## Who is using OpenStreetMap?

Individual users, developers, and researchers:

-   Apps and websites
-   Games
-   Advocacy and policy

### People for Bikes City Ratings

![](images/cityratings-people-for-bikes.png)

The Bike Network Analysis (BNA) is a data analysis tool that measures how well bike networks connect people with the places they want to go and is used for the [PeopleForBikes 2023 City Ratings](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/). The [methodology is described online](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/about/methodology) and the [PeopleForBikes · GitHub](https://github.com/PeopleForBikes) includes the full code for the analysis.

## Contributing to Open Street Map

Different editors have different reasons for contributing and contribute in different ways:

-   Individuals
-   Public agencies
-   Non-profit organizations
-   Corporations

::: notes
Different editors use different tools, focus on editing different resources.

Other options include:

-   [ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-editor-for-openstreetmap)
:::

## Tracing and digitizing imagery

Most editors for OpenStreetMap use high-resolution aerial, satellite, and drone-based imagery to trace or digitize:

-   POIs, addresses (**points**)
-   Roads, sidewalks, paths (**lines**)
-   School areas, central business districts, parks, lakes, playgrounds (**polygons**)

## Downloading data with overpass turbo

![](images/overpass-turbo-screenshot.png) [*overpass turbo*](https://overpass-turbo.eu), a web-based data filtering tool for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), can run Overpass API queries and analyze the resulting OSM data interactively on a map.

## Open Historical Map

## Downloading data with `{osmdata}`

-   [`osmdata`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/) is an R package for accessing the data underlying OpenStreetMap (OSM), delivered via the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).
-   The package is designed to allow access to small-to-medium-sized OSM datasets (see [`osmextract`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmextract) for an approach for reading-in bulk OSM data extracts).
