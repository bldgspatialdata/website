### Why Quarto?

1.  communicating to decision-makers
2.  collaborating with other data scientists
3.  as a modern-day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

It contains three important types of content:

1.  An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s.
2.  Chunks of R code surrounded by ````` ```` `````.
3.  Text mixed with simple text formatting like `# heading` and `_italics_`.

### What happens when you render a Quarto document?

::: notes
When you render the document, Quarto sends the `.qmd` file to **knitr**, <https://yihui.org/knitr/>, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (`.md`) document which includes the code and its output. The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by **pandoc**, [https://pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/), which is responsible for creating the finished file.

-   Learn how to externally source code `source()`

-   Learn how to modularize your code to make it more reproducible

-   Use a chunk at the beginning of your document to load libraries and data globally to make your document more efficient.

### How do you insert citations into a Quarto document?

Write a function for calculating the "roundness" of a POLYGON geometry. [Take a look at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundness) for details but use the formula:

Roundness = (4π × Area) / Perimeter\^2
