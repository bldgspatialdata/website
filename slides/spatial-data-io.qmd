## Spatial data is everywhere

- Shapefiles, GeoJSON files, and other spatial data files
- Spatial data editing and hosting services, e.g. [ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview) or [Felt](https://felt.com/maps/recent))
- Open data portals serving spatial and non-spatial data, e.g. [data.gov](https://data.gov/)

## Spatial data is everywhere

- Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, and navigation apps (on your phone or [in your vehicle](https://support.google.com/googleappsincar/answer/9941814?hl=en))
- Biking and running apps (Strava publishes a [global user activity heatmap](https://www.strava.com/heatmap#11.21/-76.64618/39.34348/hot/all))
- Web browsers on your phone and desktop application

## Spatial data is everywhere

- Phone camera photos (stored in the EXIF metadata)
- Calendars ([iCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar)), contacts ([vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard)), and emails (using [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation) locations)

## Creating spatial data is "easy"

- GIS Desktop applications, e.g. [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)
- Web mapping applications (e.g. [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20), [Felt](https://felt.com/))
- Spreadsheet applications (e.g. [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/))
- Database builders (e.g. [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) or [Microsoft Lists](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-lists-0a1c3ace-def0-44af-b225-cfa8d92c52d7))

## What can we do with it all?

- Read and write spatial data files
- Read and write related data files
- Read from and write to web services

## Common spatial file formats

- Shapefile (`.shp`)
- GeoJSON (`.json`, `.geojson`)
- GeoPackage (`.gpkg`)
- KML - Keyhole Markup Language (`.kml`)
- Esri File Geodatabase (`.gdb`)

::: notes

- Vector spatial: Shapefile, [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), KML
- Raster spatial: [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF), 
- Tabular data with geometry: CSV, Microsoft Excel, delimited text with coordinates or WKT (well known text)

:::

## Common spatial file formats

These file formats vary in:

- Types of geometry that they support
- Constraints or limits (e.g. shapefiles limit the lenghth of column names, GeoJSON can only use one coordinate reference system)
- File size
- Speed of input or output
- Compatibility with different tools or systems
- And more!

## Read spatial data files with R

The `dsn` or data source name for `sf::read_sf()` can include:

- a file name
- a URL
- a folder
- the name and access credentials of a database
- a character string with the contents of a GeoJSON file

## Read spatial data files with R

You can use the `query` parameter of `sf::read_sf()` to use a SQL query to select records from a file (or select a specific geographical extent).
  
## Many file formats *can* include spatial data

- Excel files (`xlsx` or `xls`)  
- vCard or VCF (Virtual Contact File)
- EXIF metadata in a JPEG, HEIC, PNG, TIFF or other media file

## Reading data into R
  
- Read data using `{sf}`
- Read data using a package that returns a `sf` object
- Read data and use `{sf}` to convert to a `sf` object

## Writing data from R

- Write data to a spatial file using `{sf}`
- Write data a a non-spatial file using a different package

When you write spatial data to a non-spatial format, you should drop the geometry or convert the geometry to coordinates or well-known text.

## Read data using `{sf}`

First load `{sf}`:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

## Read data using `{sf}`

## Read data using `{sf}`

`{sf}` can use any available drivers to read data:

```{r}
drivers <- sf::st_drivers()

drivers
```

## Read data from a URL using `{sf}`

`read_sf()` works well with a direct link to a spatial data file:

```{r}
# GeoJSON (geojson)
read_sf("https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/raw/main/inst/examples/california.geojson")
```

----

```{r}
# Keyhole Markup Language (kml)
read_sf("https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/raw/main/inst/examples/poa_annua.kml")
```

----

```{r}
# GeoPackage (gpkg)
read_sf("https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/raw/main/inst/gpkg/nc.gpkg")
```

----

Even non-spatial data works if the data includes a well-known text column:

```{r}
# Comma-separated values (csv)
read_sf("https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/raw/main/inst/csv/pt.csv")
```

----

If the non-spatial data does not include a well-known text column, `read_sf()` still returns a data frame:

```{r}
read_sf("https://github.com/elipousson/marylandedu/raw/main/data-raw/extdata/Enrollment_By_Grade_2023.csv")
```

----

However, multifile format like a shapefile does *not* work as a URL:

```{r}
# Shapefile (shp)
read_sf("https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/raw/main/inst/shape/nc.shp")
```

But it *does* work if you provide a local file path (`system.file()` returns a file path in this case):

```{r}
read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
```

----

An ArcGIS FeatureServer URL does *not* work:

```{r}
read_sf("https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_County_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0")
```

But a FeatureServer URL that includes the output format *does* work:

```{r}
read_sf("https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_County_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson")
```

## Read spatial data with other packages

There are a wide variety of packages that you can use to supplement  `{sf}`.

```{r}
library(arcgislayers)

feature_layer <- arc_open("https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_County_Boundaries/FeatureServer/0")

arc_select(feature_layer)
```
