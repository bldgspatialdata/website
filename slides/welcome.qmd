## Our goals

::: {.incremental}
- ask and answer questions with data
- ask and answer questions with *spatial* data
- *reproducibly* ask and answer questions with spatial data
- use *modern tools and methods* to reproducibly ask and answer questions with spatial data
- *collaboratively* use modern tools and methods to reproducibly ask and answer questions with data

## What is a *reproducible* data analysis?

- Can you get the same results every time you do the analysis?
- Can others get the same results?
- Can you use get the same results when you do the analysis with similar data?

## Why are you here?

<!-- FIXME: See if I want to replace the Felt exercise w/ something else -->
<!--
## How did you get here?

This isn't a metaphorical question.

Let's make a map:

-   [Open this Felt map and trace a route for your commute to campus today](https://felt.com/map/GES668-Fall-2024-Student-Commutes-16Td7dMHQGiZTkkbsHLEpC?loc=39.3041,-76.6123,11.71z)
-   Start as close or far from home as you like
-   Use the "Details" tab to add a "name" attribute (with your name) and a "mode" attribute (e.g. UMBC Shuttle, Car or truck, Bike, etc.)

🥳 Congratulations!

We just built some spatial data.

## Why am I here?

A few things about me:

-   I first started using GIS as a student studying anthropology and historic preservation at the University of Maryland College Park around 2007
-   I started learning R as a student at the John Hopkins University School of Public Health in 2019
-   I started developing R packages while working at the Neighborhood Design Center in 2020
-   I started work as a planner at the Baltimore City Department of Planning in 2022 and agency data lead in 2024

::: notes
I believe in the potential of data to build power, inform collective action, and make change in the world
:::

## What are our toolkit for this class?

- Programming tools
  - R (a programming language)
  - RStudio (an Integrated Development Environment - IDE)
  - tidyverse (a family of R packages)
  - sf (a R package for spatial data)
  - Quarto (a open-source publishing system for mixing text and code)
- Reproducibility tools
  - Git
  - GitHub
- Learning tools
  - Course website
  - GitHub classroom
  - Discord

## Communication 📬

-   I am not always on top of my email.
-   Please post questions to the Discord if you think other students could help (or others may share your question).
-   If you don't get a timely response by email, message me on Discord.

## Assignments

1.  Weekly check-in
2.  Practice exercises
3.  Final project

### Weekly check-in 📝

-   The goal of the weekly check-in is to help you stay on top of the reading and get your questions out for everyone to benefit from.

### Practice exercises 🛠️

<!-- FIXME: Are practice exercises optional or required? How wiill they be graded? -->
-   Each practice exercise will include a mix of questions and coding prompts excerpted or adapted from R for Data Science, Geocomputation with R, and other resources.

-   Questions may include both close-ended "fill in the blank" style questions and more open-ended prompts.

-   Feedback on the exercises is welcome!

<!--
### Final project

The final project includes a few elements:

-   A proposal
-   A presentation
-   A reproducible project repository

The proposal and presentation will both be built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) using the [HTML document](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and [Reveal.js presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) formats.
-->
<!-- FIXME: What is happening with the final project? -->

## Readings 📚

-   What are the readings?
-   What is the difference between required and optional readings?
-   How can you get the most out of the readings?

### R for Data Science

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/cover.jpg)

### Geocomputation with R

![](images/book_cover_r2.jpg)

::: footer
Note that this book also includes extensive information on raster data. This is *not* a topic covered in any detail as part of this class and can be skipped.
:::

### Other readings and resources

- Vignettes and other R package documentation
- Recorded presentations
- Journal articles

<!-- ### All Data are Local

![](https://mit-press-us.imgix.net/covers/9780262545174.jpg?auto=format&w=298&dpr=2&q=20) -->

### Required vs. Optional

- Optional readings may include whole books or websites. These are recommended if you are interested in learning more about a topic—but may be infeasible

### Getting the most out of readings

Take notes on questions or observations while you reading. Use these notes to submit your weekly check-in.

Readings on coding in R should be done at a computer with RStudio open. Try re-typing code from the text into RStudio and running the code to see how it works.

## Miscellaneous

### What can you expect during class

### Make this a safe and mutually supportive space

We are all learning! No prior programming experience is required and we should all work to make this an inclusive experienced for everyone.

### Attendance and remote participation

**Do come to class.** You'll get the most out of this semester if you are present and participating.

**Don't come to class sick!** Please prioritize your health and well-being if you are sick or need to care for someone else.

You *can* participate online if you need to. We can screen share sessions to Discord and record lectures if needed.

### Using ChatGPT or other LLMs

-   You *are* strongly discouraged from using ChatGPT, Claude, or other large language models to help with your project or, if desired, assignments.

-   You *must* include information about when and how you use it including your specific prompts and tools used.

-   You *should* use these tools with caution. They provide non-working code and describe non-existent functions and packages. Don't let this tool stand in the way of developing your own understanding of R and how it works.

## Welcome again!
