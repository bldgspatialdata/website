## What is this class about?


## What is this class about?

- Working with data using R

## What is this class about? {auto-animate=true}

- Working with ~~data~~ spatial data using R

## What is this class about? {auto-animate=true}

- Working with spatial data *about places*

## What is this class about? {auto-animate=true}

- Working with spatial data *about **people and** places*

## What is this class about? {auto-animate=true}

- Working with ~~spatial data~~ **local knowledge** about people and places

## Why are you here?

## How did you get here?

This isn't a metaphorical question.

Let's make a map:

- [Open this Felt map and trace a route for your commute to campus today](https://felt.com/map/GES668-Fall-2024-Student-Commutes-16Td7dMHQGiZTkkbsHLEpC?loc=39.3041,-76.6123,11.71z)
- Start as close or far from home as you like
- Use the "Details" tab to add a "name" attribute (with your name) and a "mode" attribute (e.g. UMBC Shuttle, Car or truck, Bike, etc.)

ü•≥ Congratulations!

We just built some spatial data.

## Why am I here?

A few things about me:

-   I first started using GIS tools as a student studying anthropology and historic preservation at the University of Maryland College Park around 2007
-   I started learning R as a student at the John Hopkins University School of Public Health in 2019
-   I started developing R packages while working at the Neighborhood Design Center in 2020
-   I work as a community planner at the Baltimore City Department of Planning (since June 2022)

::: {.notes}
I believe in the potential of data to build power, inform collective action, and make change in the world

## Communication üì¨

- I am not always on top of my email.
- Please post questions to the Discord if you think other students could help (or others may share your question).
- If you don't get a timely response by email, message me on Discord.

## Assignments

1. Weekly check-in
2. Practice exercises
3. Final project

### Weekly check-in üìù

- The goal of the weekly check-in is to help you stay on top of the reading and get your questions out for everyone to benefit from.

### Practice exercises üõ†Ô∏è

- Each practice exercise will include a mix of questions and coding prompts excerpted or adapted from R for Data Science, Geocomputation with R, and other resources.

-  Questions may include both close-ended "fill in the blank" style questions and more open-ended prompts.

- Feedback on the exercises is welcome!

### Final project 

The final project includes a few elements:

- A proposal
- A presentation
- A reproducible project repository

The proposal and presentation will both be built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) using the [HTML document](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and [Reveal.js presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) formats.

## Readings üìö

- What are the readings?
- How can you get the most out of the readings?

### R for Data Science

### Geocomputation with R

::: footer
Note that this book also includes extensive information on raster data. This is *not* a topic covered in any detail as part of this class and can be skipped.

### All Data are Local

## Miscellaneous

### Make this a safe and mutually supportive space 

We are all learning! No prior programming experience is required and we should all work to make this an inclusive experienced for everyone.

### Attendance and remote participation

**Do come to class.** You'll get the most out of this semester if you are present and participating.

**Don't come to class sick!** Please prioritize your health and well-being if you are sick or need to care for someone else.

You *can* participate online if you need to. We can screen share sessions to Discord and record lectures if needed.

### Using ChatGPT or other LLM for coding

- You *are* allowed to use ChatGPT or other large language models to help with your project or, if desired, assignments.

- You *must* include information about when and how you use it including your specific prompts and tools used.

- You *should* use these tools with caution. They provide non-working code and describe non-existent functions and packages. Don't let this tool stand in the way of developing your own understanding of R and how it works.

## Welcome again!
