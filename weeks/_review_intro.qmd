Here is a quick summary of what we learned this week:

-   How the RStudio IDE interface is organized around a console, help pane, source pane, and environment pane (check out the [RStudio IDE Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf) for a quick reference)
-   How functions start with inputs (also known as arguments or parameters), produce side effects (e.g. informational messages), and return outputs (e.g. a character string or a `sf` object)
-   How `sf` objects are structured around attributes and geometries
- How R code is executed within a development environment where packages or objects are loaded
-   How and when to restart an R session to reset the environment

Here are a few questions for additional reflection:

-   How does coding in R or other languages support reproducible spatial data analysis?
-   Why use R for working with spatial data?
