  abstract = {The discipline of Geography has long been intertwined with the use of computers. This close interaction is likely to increase with the embeddedness of computers and concomitant growth of spatially referenced data. To better understand the current situation, and to be able to better speculate about the future, this article provides two parallel perspectives: first, we offer an historical perspective on the relationship between Geography and computers; second, we document developments—in particular the nascent field of data science—that are currently taking place outside of Geography and to which we argue the discipline should be paying close attention. Combining both perspectives, we identify the benefits of tighter integration between Geography and Data Science and argue for the establishment of a new space—that we term Geographic Data Science—in which cross-pollination could occur to the benefit of both Geography and the larger data community.},

  abstract = {This paper was presented as the 8th annual Transactions in GIS plenary address at the American Association of Geographers annual meeting in Washington, DC. The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze nonplanar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This paper reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools. The paper concludes with paths forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.},

  abstract = {This paper reflects on a number of trends towards a more open and reproducible approach to geographic and spatial data science over recent years. In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering ‘black boxes’ where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for \$\$n\$\$\,=\,all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

Rather, they represent the interests and goals of the groups and institutions that are doing the data collection. These interests and goals may be liberatory, discriminatory, or something in between. In all cases, we argue that an analysis of social inequality is essential to understanding the ethical impacts of data collection and use. To aid such analysis, we introduce a model of power out of sociology called the matrix of domination. This model helps us understand why collecting data is political, why not collecting data is also political, and what actions we can take to address unequal social relations using data science.},

Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto you can create documents, books, presentations, blogs or other online resources. Should I take this? As with all the community meetups, everyone is welcome. This will be especially interesting to you if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of Quarto for literate data science programming in academia, science, and industry. This workshop will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these questions: Have you programmed in R and want to better encapsulate your code, documentation, and outputs in a cohesive “data product”? Do you want to learn about the next generation of R Markdown for data science? Do you want to have a better interactive experience when writing technical or scientific documents with literate programming? For more info on Quarto: quarto.org},

Abstract: Collaborating on code development and tracking changes in code across versions are daily issues for big teams.  This hands-on workshop will be a gentle introduction to learning how to manage and keep tracking your source code history by walking through basic Git and GitHub fundamentals. Mount will also share with you her experience in creating the \{git-github\} cheatsheet which focuses on the essential git commands in a good visual design.    Requirements:  ✔️ R \& RStudio installed  ✔️ Please sign up for a free GitHub account here https://github.com/  ✔️ Download and install Git by following this link https://git-scm.com/downloads},

Tidycensus allows R users to swiftly access custom extracts of decennial Census and American Community Survey data and formats it for analysis with R’s tidyverse suite of packages. Participants will learn the basics of tidycensus; how to summarize and explore Census data with tidyverse tools; and how to create informative Census data visualizations in R.

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},
