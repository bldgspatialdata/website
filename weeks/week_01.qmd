## Overview

### Agenda

-   Welcome to GES668!
-   Introduction to R for spatial data
-   Introduction to reproducible data analysis

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="true"}
#### Key Objectives

-   Explore key functions from the `{sf}` package and `{tidyverse}` family of packages
-   Create a self-contained project in RStudio
-   Practice creating files with a consistent naming convention

#### Questions

-   How does R support reproducible spatial data analysis?
-   Why use R for working with spatial data?
:::

### What we covered

#### Skills

-   Installing packages with `install.packages()`
-   Loading packages with `library()`
-   Using the `?` operator to look up function documentation
-   Using `st_read()` to read a `sf` object from a file path
-   Using an assignment operator (`<-` or `=`) to save function output in a new object
-   Using `View()` and `mapview()` to interactively explore spatial data

#### Concepts

-   How the RStudio IDE interface is organized around a console, help pane, source pane, and environment pane
-   How functions start with inputs (also known as arguments or parameters), produce side effects (e.g. informational messages), and return outputs (e.g. a character string or a `sf` object)
-   How `sf` objects are structured around attributes and geometries
- How R code is executed within a development environment where packages or objects are loaded
-   How and when to restart an R session and reset the environment
