## Overview

Welcome to Building Spatial Datasets!

Our first session starts with a general introduction to the course and a quick introduction to using R for working with spatial data.

### Key Objectives

-   Provide an overview of the scope and schedule of the course
-   Introduce the concept of **reproducibility** and key reproducible practices for data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, and tracking work
-   Configure RStudio and create a RStudio project
-   Introduce the concept of **simple features** and how the concept is implemented by the `{sf}` package
-   Create a Quarto document to practice using the `{tidyverse}` and `{sf}` package

### Key Skills

-   Creating self-contained projects with RStudio
-   Installing packages with `install.packages()`
-   Loading packages with `library()`
-   Using the `?` operator to look up function documentation
-   Using `str()` or `View()` to look at an object
-   Using an assignment operator (`<-` or `=`) to save an output to a new object
-   Creating and editing Quarto documents with RStudio
-   Using `sf::st_read()` to read a `sf` object from a file path or URL

### Getting ready for the first class

Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer. If you already have R installed, please check to make sure your installation is up to date. For more details, check out [the Prerequisites section from R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites) (one of a few books we'll use in our class).

Install Git on your computer. The easiest option is to [install the GitHub Desktop application](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (which installs Git at the same time). Alternatively, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) details a few different ways to install Git on Windows, OSX, or Linux.

[Sign up for a GitHub user account](https://github.com/signup). I use GitHub to distribute assignments and you will use GitHub to submit assignments. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) makes it easier to use Git for version control and is the most popular platform for collaborative development work. People use GitHub for everything from writing R packages to textbooks!

[Join our course Discord](https://discord.gg/k7JkwD6R). I use Discord to share class announcements and encourage students to use the Discord to share links and questions throughout the semester.

[Complete the student survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRg0oOK9y50PrwhRAvux0-ANVvi6vkeebATHX9iH4Lia5fbA/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is how you share your GitHub username. I'd also love to know more about what experiences you're bringing to the class and what you hope to learn.

If you have not done any programming before, I'd recommend taking some time to review [The Very Basics](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html) and [Packages and Help Pages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) (section 2 and 3 from [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)).
