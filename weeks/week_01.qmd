## Prepare

### Getting ready for the first class

-   Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer. Review [these instructions if needed](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio).
-   If you don't already have a GitHub account, [register for a GitHub user account](https://github.com/signup). Review [these instructions if needed](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct).
-   Install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) (the installer will also install Git on your computer).
-   Use [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_J0u7FX3cqGCBzw_MED7hFWlpsUXYsclvAAvvRf9ve8MEmw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to share your GitHub username (and a little background)
-   Join the [class Discord](https://discord.gg/K9un5cXy).
-   Bring a computer to class (if you can).
-   üìñ Read the [syllabus](/course-syllabus.html)

## Notes

### What skills did we introduce this week

-   Installing packages with `install.packages()`
-   Loading packages with `library()`
-   Using the `?` operator to look up function documentation
-   Using `sf::st_read()` to read a `sf` object from a file path
-   Using an assignment operator (`<-` or `=`) to save function output in a new object
-   Using `View()` and `mapview::mapview()` to interactively explore spatial data

### What concepts did we discuss this week

-   How the RStudio IDE interface is organized around a console, help pane, source pane, and environment pane (check out the [RStudio IDE Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf) for a quick reference)
-   How functions start with inputs (also known as arguments or parameters), produce side effects (e.g. informational messages), and return outputs (e.g. a character string or a `sf` object)
-   How `sf` objects are structured around attributes and geometries
- How R code is executed within a development environment where packages or objects are loaded
-   How and when to restart an R session to reset the environment
