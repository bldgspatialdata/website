## Overview

Welcome to Building Spatial Datasets!

Our first session starts with a general introduction to the course and a hands-on introduction to using R for working with spatial data.

### Key Objectives

-   Provide an overview of the scope and schedule of the course
-   Introduce the concept of **reproducibility** and key reproducible practices for data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, and tracking work
-   Configure RStudio and create a RStudio project
-   Introduce the concept of **simple features** and how the concept is implemented by the `{sf}` package
-   Create a Quarto document to practice using the `{tidyverse}` and `{sf}` package

### Key Skills

-   Creating self-contained projects with RStudio
-   Installing packages with `install.packages()`
-   Loading packages with `library()`
-   Using the `?` operator to look up function documentation
-   Using `str()` or `View()` to look at an object
-   Using an assignment operator (`<-` or `=`) to save an output to a new object
-   Creating and editing Quarto documents with RStudio
-   Using `sf::st_read()` to read a `sf` object from a file path or URL

### Getting ready for the first class

- [ ] Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer. If you already have R installed, please check to make sure your installation is up to date. For more details, check out [the Prerequisites section from R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites) (one of a few books we'll use in our class).

- [ ] [Sign up for a GitHub user account](https://github.com/signup). I use GitHub to distribute assignments and you will use GitHub to submit assignments. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) is one of the most popular platform for collaborative coding and makes using Git for version control easier. People use GitHub for everything from writing R packages to textbooks!

- [ ] Install Git on your computer. One easy option is to [install the GitHub Desktop application](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (which installs Git at the same time). Alternatively, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) details a few different ways to [download and install](https://git-scm.com/install/) Git on Windows, OSX, or Linux.

- [ ] [Join our course Discord](https://discord.gg/k7JkwD6R). I use Discord to share class announcements and encourage students to use the Discord to share links and questions throughout the semester.

- [ ] [Complete the student survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRg0oOK9y50PrwhRAvux0-ANVvi6vkeebATHX9iH4Lia5fbA/viewform?usp=sf_link). This is how you share your GitHub username. I'd also love to know more about what experiences you're bringing to the class and what you hope to learn.

- [ ] If you have not done any programming before, I recommend taking some time to review [The Very Basics](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html) and [Packages and Help Pages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) (section 2 and 3 from [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)).
