## Overview

This week is all about making plots and maps using the `{ggplot}` package. Learning to visualize data is a great place for start learning how to exploring data analytically and understanding the value of tidy data when working with R.

### Key Objectives

-   Introduce the concept of a "pipe" (`%>%` or `|>`) and how and when to use it
-   Introduce the concept of the "grammar of graphics"
-   Practice plotting and mapping data with `{ggplot2}`
-   Practice mapping data with `{mapview}` (TODO: Make sure interactive maps are included in the slides/exercise)

### Key Skills

- Using keyboard shortcuts in RStudio (TODO: Add keyboard shortcut for a pipe and assignment operator)
- Creating plots using `ggplot()`, `aes()`, and `geom_()` functions
- Creating static maps using `geom_sf()` and `coord_sf()`
- Creating interactive maps using `mapview()`
- Using `theme_` functions to customize the appearance of a plot
- Using `labs()` to add labels to a plot
