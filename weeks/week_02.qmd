## Overview

This week is all about making plots and maps using the `{ggplot}` package. Learning to visualize data is a great place for start learning how to exploring data analytically and understanding the value of tidy data when working with R.

### Key Objectives

-   Introduce the concept of a "pipe" (`%>%` or `|>`) and how and when to use it
-   Introduce the concept of the "grammar of graphics"
-   Practice plotting and mapping data with `{ggplot2}`
-   Practice mapping data with `{mapview}`

```

### Key Skills

-   Using keyboard shortcuts in RStudio
-   Creating plots using `ggplot()`, `aes()`, and `geom_()` functions
-   Creating static maps using `geom_sf()` and `coord_sf()`
-   Creating interactive maps using `mapview()`
-   Using `theme_` functions to customize the appearance of a plot
-   Using `labs()` to add labels to a plot
