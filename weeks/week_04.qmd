## Overview

This week is to learn to use `{dplyr}` and `{sf}` in combination to create and manipulate attributes associated with spatial data.

### Key Objectives

-   Review key concepts of simple features in R
-   Introduce key concepts for spatial attribute data (e.g. point vs. block support)
-   Practice using `{sf}` functions for *geometric confirmation* (`st_intersects()`, `st_disjoint()`) and *geometric measurement* (`st_area()`, `st_length()`, `st_distance()`)
-   Discuss ideas for final projects
